--------------------------------------------
A few weeks back my friends at Hasbro sent Bella a special package containing the new @playdoh Poop Troop set.
--------------------------------------------
Needless to say it has quickly become her favourite Play-Doh set she has, and trust me when I say she‚Äôs a Play-Doh addict and has dozens of sets!
--------------------------------------------
Funny story, last year when it was her turn to make homemade play dough for her class she snuck the container of play dough back in her backpack and brought it home. Why you ask? Because she loves her play dough and it would be lonely at school all night ü§£
--------------------------------------------
Don‚Äôt worry, we sent it back the next day!
--------------------------------------------
The new Play-Doh Poop Troop set comes with 12 containers of Play-Doh, 5 tools and 14 accessories to help make 50+ poo combinations!
--------------------------------------------
It retails for around $19.99 and I‚Äôve put a link in my profile for you to buy online, it will make a great birthday or Christmas gift for any Play-Doh or Poop Emoji lover!

137,1969076323695735338.jpg,"That yellow building behind me was one of the most beautiful ‚Äúcasa particulares‚Äù (Cuban homestays) I saw on the island.
::::::
Behind its crumbly, pastel-colored facade was a home filled with a hodge-podge of mid-century wooden antiques, yellowed hardback books, lush green trees sweeping into and out of rooms, walls painted in bright teal and mustard, and colorful stained glass windows.üå¥ Dreamy, to say the least.
::::::
In my terribly broken Spanish, I knocked on the door and begged the host for a room for our last night in Havana. It was fully booked. üíî
::::::
But instead of a room, the hospitable young host offered me a home tour, a Spanish lesson, and a jar of the sweetest Cuban honey (‚Äúmiel‚Äù) as a parting gift. üçØ
::::::
I guarded that honey with my life for the rest of the trip, and when my luggage got lost on my way home, that was probably my biggest concern.
::::::
You see, Cuban honey is not like other honeys. Because farmers don‚Äôt use pesticides (too expensive) and much of the Cuban countryside is wild (no financial incentive to farm), the honeybee population is thriving. üêù They feast on flowers, cocoa, and tobacco, giving the honey a floral and almost smokey or spicy flavor.
::::::
It‚Äôs more fluid like agave nectar than it is sticky like sap. It goes in strong Cuban coffee or drizzled on fluffy arepas or even coating the tip of a cigar.
::::::
Thankfully, my Cuban miel made it back to the States safe and sound, but it probably won‚Äôt be sticking around much longer. üòã

::::::
For the past couple of days, the island has been getting ready for the biggest holiday of the year: Nyepi (otherwise known as the Balinese ‚ÄúDay of Silence‚Äù). ü§´ All temples on the island make a pilgrimage, typically by foot, to the closest beach, where they prepare to be cleansed from evil spirits to start the Balinese New Year on a clean slate.
::::::
Villages that are further inland often walk for three days to reach the shore, although some more modern villages will load their statues into trucks and drive. üòâ
::::::
Then, after all-night revelries, including parades through the streets with colorful statues, banners, and parasols, as well as rituals like hitting pots and pans and setting off firecrackers to scare away evil spirits, the island goes silent.
::::::
People are prohibited from leaving their homes and using lights, so the streets and beaches are completely dead, homes are dark, and the skies come alive with billions of stars at night. ‚ú® The airports close for 24 hours, and locals and expats stock up on food and empty out the markets like there‚Äôs an impending apocalypse. üòÇ It also means that WiFi and social media are blocked on the island, so I‚Äôll be MIA until Friday comes around.

I didn't know what I was getting when you came into my life. I knew you were special when I got my audition to potentially be a part of your world. When I walked into mama @imarleneking 's office and made a joke about tequila and it landed I should have realized that I was home. People talk about LA and the dream of being on a studio lot and being on a TV show, but the reality blows the dream out of the water. You have been my favorite thing I've looked forward to for the past 4 years. As a girl who was homeschooled and never knew what it was to ""fit in"" you have made me feel cool and accepted. Unbeknownst to you you got me through the heart ache of being dumped by what I thought was my dream job, loved me when I left to lick my wounds on the east coast, then welcomed me home and gave me a break from the grind and let me be a girly girl; painted my nails gave me lashes and a green juice and told me to try my hand at creating CeCe or Charles or my sweet Charlotte. @sashapieterse27 you helped me through what could have been the most stressful week of my life: simultaneously planning my wedding and playing the iconic role of A. Pll army pat yourself on the back for giving us loyalty and kindness and devotion, you are each a part of the love and respect I experienced every second I've been a part of this. Little sister, you have quite simply changed my life. I am a more creative person because of your fierce strong female embodiment. Thank you @imarleneking for including me in this world.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢
The last couple of weeks I noticed an increasing change of this platform - maybe it has been there before but I just closed my eyes for it? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢
I‚Äôve seen accounts ‚Äûgrowing‚Äú almost over night & I‚Äôve seen some of them dropping again üìäI‚Äòve seen huge companies working with bloggers with obvious fake engagement. ü§ØI‚Äôve been declined by firms only to see they chose another account with a little more followers - but when I checked their statistics it was easy to see that half of them were bought. üìà I‚Äôve seen pics getting 3.000 likes after 10 mins but the same pic has only 4.000 likes 12 hrs later. üôÑ I‚Äôve seen people cheating their way to the top, lying straight to their followers and thanking them for the ‚Äûamazing‚Äú engagement. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢
I feel like I‚Äôm losing my love for this app seeing this - I wonder if it‚Äôs still worth it.ü§îAnd I just don‚Äôt get why marketing managers of worldwide known companies don‚Äôt do their research - it literally takes a few minutes to check if numbers on an account are real. üßê
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢
But at the same time I see wonderful accounts inspiring REAL people with REAL moments. üôèüèº And this is what keeps me on this platform - cause I always believe in the good in people and even in the good in @instagram . ü§ó

[Journal Activity]: I‚Äôm soo fed-up w/ people taking my heart && kindness for granted!
I‚Äôm freaking too nice sometimes.
Either they‚Äôre intimidated at first sight, but once they see the heart they treat me as a fool.
But that‚Äôs my fault!
WELL NEVER AGAIN!
There‚Äôs a balance for everything && I should not do anything that interferes with my happiness just to prove a simple act of kindness. 
It holds you stagnant. 
There‚Äôs soo many people in this world; yet alot of us still feel so alone! 
It seems like all this generation cares about is socialmedia && having their faces glued to their phones. && now that I have noticed myself participating... I am now pulling back. I‚Äôm done w/ the fakes && anything that interferes with my happiness && alter-ego (Initial inner spirit). Follow OR unfollow- I don‚Äôt give a damn. I‚Äôm not going to play this game w/ anyone. Only kind of game I‚Äôm going to play is the one I have no choice but to play since I‚Äôm already here on this earth. && that‚Äôs NO Coincidence. && I will definitely come out the winner. 
Not taking failure OR bullsh*t as my option.
MY DESTINY IS MINE && SHALL MANIFEST!
If you‚Äôre fed-up w/ all the bullshit && 2018 MUST be a great year... You have my support as well.

786,1777320417993465908.jpg,"Recently, one of my favorite travel Instagrammers @travel_inhershoes made a post asking people how many ‚Äúlives‚Äù they‚Äôd had, and shared her own story. I love this idea! 
I think I have had quite a few ‚Äúlives‚Äù (no, this isn‚Äôt mystical stuff, just about life experiences! ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è)
Life 1: As a kid, my family moved constantly, and as the oldest of 9 kids, there was never a dull or quiet moment in the house! I read books constantly, invented complex kingdoms with their own social customs and histories and cultures and languages, and dreamed of faraway lands.
Life 2: As an older kid and teenager, I was actually very depressed for years and went through a lot of sadness. I longed for a day when I could be free and happy. 
Life 3: I went from a university student to an idealistic wanderer; I became homeless and went on a walking roadtrip, I lived on a small mountain underneath the stars in North Carolina. I lived on a total of about $10 a month.
Life 4: I moved to Miami and became a model, I was unexpectedly successful at this and within a year was making more money than I could have dreamed of. I invested in apartments and rented all of them out on Airbnb. I eventually stopped modeling to get a ‚Äúreal career‚Äù and ‚Äúbe a grown-up‚Äù with a great job. I began investing in the stock market market. I had the apartments, the car, the job. But I was unhappy. I realized one day that I was living what defined someone else‚Äôs dream - not mine.
Life 5: I quit my job and sold everything to go on a three-month trip across Europe. I started filming some fairly awful videos that gradually got better. Three months later, I skipped my return flight. 2.5 years later, I‚Äôm still on that same trip, doing what I love and hopefully inspiring others to do the same!

This mask contains Hyaluronic Acid, anti-aging Retinol and Peptides and a whipped texture that will for sure make people fall in love.

The restoring night eye gels are great to use on your undereyes after a long day before bed. These eye gels help with moisturizing your undereyes and helping your eyes feel great by the morning. These eye gels only take 5 mins before bed and they are a good way to relax your eyes as well. I love using these to relax and in the morning my eyes feel so refreshed.

Thanks @joinpalm for sending these my way to use and try as these products are definitely going to be part of my winter routine!

951,1840348601882779729.jpg,"Ah, the dog days of summer. Sunny days, sundresses, and cocktails with little umbrellas in them. ...yeah, right. More like brow-sticking sweat, itchy trousers, and floppy-collared piques polos with more absorbency than two-ply TP. What results is that most dreaded of office uniforms: the ‚Äúpolo and ‚Äúkhakis.‚Äù
How to fix this most vexing of problems and keep yourself from becoming an Office Space extra? 
First, get your fit right. Oversized polo=more fabric, more weight, more sticky sweat to hold own on to. Size down, my friends. 
Two, consider your fabric. This one from @expressmen is made with a light, moisture- wicking performance fabric made to withstand the heat summer throws your way. 
Third, get your collar right. This one is nice and crisp, and gives you a clean, professional appearance. 
Fourth, consider your trousers. No triple-pleated pants with a twelve-inch leg opening here. Keep ‚Äòem slim and opt for little to even no break in them for a slick appearance. 
Follow these tips, and Milton might let you borrow his stapler. 
Your turn, gents. How do you stay cool in the summer swelter?

I love a heavy denim work shirt when mercury drops and all I want to snuggle up with a good book and some hot tea. But what if when the thermometer goes way up and weather is sizzlin‚Äô hot? 
Consider keeping a denim shirt of the lighter variety in your summer rotation.

This one, from @expressmen, is lighter in weight. I‚Äôm not able to give a close-up (forgot my macro lens on shoot day üò¨), but the slightly more open weave allows for better airflow. As an added bonus, the lighter color may absorb less light. 
Still too warm for you? Throw on a Panama hat and some linen trousers! Have a good week, gents .

954,1875858999201259848.jpg,"Let‚Äôs start thinking about that fall transition, shall we?

Pack up your linens and pull out your flannel. Swap your shorts for that crisp, raw, selvedge denim you‚Äôve been dying to break in. Throw on your tweeds and look forward to that first morning frost. Stand in line for that PSL or whatever equivalent my Dunkin‚Äô friends drink this time of year. 
For me, nothing screams ‚ÄúIT‚ÄôS FALL!‚Äù more than a great pair of boots.

My go-to this season is from @thursdayboots, and it‚Äôs their Captain cap-toe boot in a Natural Chromexcel from the @horweenleather tannery. 
The boots themselves are pretty to look at. The slope is just right. The heel is substantial, but doesn‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre walking around in Louboutins. What really does it for me, though, is the color. The Chromexcel process allows the dye to shift throughout your boot, giving them a look unique to you. They‚Äôll move *with* you and pick up the scuffs, scraps, and some of the blue from that fresh denim. The more you  wear them- the better the patina gets. 
Dress them up with a blazer and an OCBD, or dress it down with a T-shirt while knocking out your Saturday errands. Sip your PSL and watch the heads turn. 
Cheers to Fall. 
Of course, this isn‚Äôt sponsored. I just dig what Thursday is doing. And well, Fall is just the best. .

Broadly speaking, colors are divided into ‚Äúwarm‚Äù and ‚Äúcool‚Äù tones. Reds, oranges, browns, and tans are distinctly ‚Äòwarm.‚Äô Conversely, blue, green, and grey are ‚Äòcool.‚Äô When selecting an outfit, I‚Äôm thinking less about items that ‚Äúmatch‚Äù and more about items that *complement*.

Yes, green! 
My foundational colors are the menswear classics of blue, brown, and grey, but green is my wildcard. And what better way to do that than a topcoat? 
Consider this one from @expressmen 
It hits just above the knee, making it a classic length that‚Äôs at home with a suit as running errands on Saturday morning. 
It‚Äôs also double breasted, which adds warm as well as sartorial flair.
The substantial lapels and collar add protection from the elements too.

958,1948322650562467719.jpg,"I haven‚Äôt always been a turtleneck fan. I had one as a 14-year-old; it was a ribbed cotton number with a navy horizontal stripe across the chest. I remember that just as well as the horrible razor acne that came with it after a thoroughly unpleasant electric shave across my neck. Never again, I said. 
Then I discovered the merino wool ones from @uniqlo. They‚Äôre super soft, so it‚Äôs kind to your neck. They‚Äôre thin- in a good way- so you can layer them under your suits and blazers. They‚Äôre supremely light, so you‚Äôre kept warm, but won‚Äôt be sweating bullets if you end up wearing one to a large social gathering. 
This isn‚Äôt sponsored, but I do believe their sweaters are some of the best values on the market right now.

I think it‚Äôs tempting to google ‚Äúquotes on menswear‚Äù, throw up some text by Coco Chanel or Winston Churchill, and post it up on the Internet going for clicks. That may make for easy posting, but that‚Äôs not how I operate. .
Song lyrics are marginally better. Unless they‚Äôre by Florida Georgia Line. 
Then they‚Äôre definitely not better. .
Either way, I think it makes for easy content. And I‚Äôve fallen into that trap before. .
My friend Anthony over at @the_next_gentleman once told me you can use a platform and a mouthpiece to teach someone how to do something, share knowledge, or get someone to think. And I do try that here.

962,2004108301152621984.jpg,"In the 16-odd months I‚Äôve been running The Gent Next Door, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to work with phenomenal companies from all over the world. It‚Äôs been a wild ride. As we‚Äôve grown, we‚Äôre able to be a little more selective. But, when @bananarepublic approached me to style some of their Spring collection for the next few months, it was an offer I couldn‚Äôt refuse.

Their classic look has always resonated with my personal style, and I‚Äôve worn BR for the last 15 years. 
But, what I like most about @bananarepublic is how even a company so ubiquitous can still be so innovative. Take this polo I‚Äôm wearing, for instance. It‚Äôs cotton, yes- but they‚Äôve woven some cashmere threads in for a luxe touch. That adds just a touch of warmth, which works really well for the spring transition and even into the cooler summer nights. Neat, huh?

And, as always, the fit is on point.

So, stay tuned for the next few months as more of the Spring collection pops in!

Love this new striped T that will be a great transition piece for Fall. It‚Äôs a heavier weight in between a sweater and a sweatshirt. I grabbed this in a petite medium and it has a looser fit.

Here‚Äôs how I pick a featured post for #saturdayswoon - I go to the magnifying glass and search a hashtag like #interiorstyling or #dreamhouse. 
When a photo jumps out at me, I click on it and check to see if it‚Äôs credited to another person. If it is, I find the post on the creator‚Äôs feed. Once I‚Äôve determined the original content creator, I browse their remaining posts. If everything is stunning, I look to see how many followers they have. If that number doesn‚Äôt correlate with the quality of their posts, I‚Äôve found my swoon-worthy feature!

For the longest time I honestly never really understood the whole ‚Äútaking the day to remember‚Äù  thing into consideration.
 I mean I was obviously just so surrounded by people trying to take really cool photos with the American flag and just basically represent the aesthetics, which there is nothing wrong with that...but as I grew older and with a lot more traveling recently ,being able to come home to a country where we have freedom to worship anything, we have the freedom to use our voice, equality ,  I mean we just have so much to be thankful for.. I love that Being able to create @youtube videos is a way to inspire & also  to share my story! and I hope that it will change something or somebody in the world.
My parents are honestly my heroes and my dad is a hero for all of us along with thousands of people who have lost their lives or time with their families to be able to give us free will!

I mean if you haven‚Äôt guessed or seen already,  I am OBSESSED  with traveling & exploring. 
I mean literally since the first day I was adopted at 3 years old I have been on a plane traveling &jet setting my wonders. 
There is just something about arriving in a city that I have never been to or new smells or new sounds... I don‚Äôt know I just get so caught up in exploring that I constantly am doing itü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
One of my favorite places that I have been to several times is Italy.
Every time I have been it‚Äôs always a new and wonderful experience and so but I got to share that experience with one of my best friends @_brittanyfriar !
 @_brittanyfriar has been such a wonderful person in my life for the past five years or so and to be able to explore somewhere I have never been with her was just perfect. 
We got lost, we missed our flight , we got 1ST CLASS ON @emirates Airline I mean... she is meant to be in my lifeüòò
I honestly believe God gave me this gift for reason .. I‚Äôm still tapping into the beginning of it but for the past couple years I have been able to record my adventures and make a documentary I guess of my life in my own way on @youtube.
I‚Äôm so thankful for the people who have been able to explore with me and see so much beauty in this world. I hope all of you get to explore your dream places one day so you Will understand exactly what I mean. 
I guess I‚Äôm just feeling a little sentimental so I decided to share that with you all enjoy the videoüé•
